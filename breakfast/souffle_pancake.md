4. Fold the egg whites into the main mixture (first bit can be quickly whisked in)
5. With pan on very low heat, dollop the batter, cover with a lid for a bit, and then dollop a little more on top to create height (total 3 minutes).
6. Pour a spoonful of water into the pan, and steam for 1 minute.
7. Flip, add another spoonful of water, and steam for another 3-4 minutes.
