## Ingredients

- Bun
  - 400 grams all purpose flour
  - 167 grams hot water
  - 2 grams salt
  - 140 grams warm water
  - 27 grams oil
- Filling
  - 300 grams ground beef
  - 1 tablespoon minced ginger
  - 2 sticks green onions
  - 1/4 onion
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 2 tablespoons soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon rice wine
  - 1/2 teaspoon finely ground pepper
  - 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
  - 1 tablespoon oil
  - 1 1/2 tablespoons water

## Directions

1. Prepare bun
   1. Mix flour with hot water
      - It won't entirely come together
   2. Add salt and warm water
   3. Roll into a sticky ball and leave covered for half an hour
   4. Add oil and knead into dough until oil is absorbed
   5. Let sit covered for at least 2 hours
2. Make filling
   1. Mix ingredients together until meat strands form
   2. Add green onion and ginger
3. Make buns
   1. Coat meat ball in flour to prevent sticking
   2. Flatten dough and roll up to make buns
   3. Make sure to seal tightly
   4. Pan fry at low heat

## Extra notes

- Make dough thinner next time
  - Probably can use more filling then
- Skipped water this time, add next time for more juice
- Dough is very chewy and nice, maybe cooler warm water so not too chewy
