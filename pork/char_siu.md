## Ingredients

- Pork (Boston butt/梅肉, belly/楠肉, neck/頸肉)
- Lee Kum Kee char siu sauce
- Light soy sauce
- Honey

## Directions

1. Cut pork into strips 1 inch thick and 2 inches wide
2. Marinate pork in fridge with 3:1 char siu sauce and soy sauce for 4-48 hours depending on thickness of meat
   - Poking holes in meat may help with flavor
3. Preheat oven to 275 F
4. Put pork on roasting tray so air can circulate under
5. Make mixture of 1:1 char siu sauce and honey
6. Roast in oven for 1 hour, flipping and basting every 15 minutes
7. Broil for 2 minutes each side at 425 F for char if wanted
8. Let hang (preferably hanging) and cut after 30-45 minutes

## Extra notes

- Pork neck was kind of dry, might have been too thin
- The instructions have instructions for making own char siu sauce and using charcoal grill
- Marion's recipe maybe easier way to make own sauce
