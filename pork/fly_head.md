## Ingredients

- Ground pork
- Garlic
- Red pepper
- 豆鼓
- Rice wine
- Soy sauce
- Sugar
- 韭菜花 (Chive flowers)

## Directions

1. Brown ground pork and separate chunks
2. Add minced garlic and red pepper and stir fry for a bit
3. Add the 豆鼓 and stir fry for a bit
    - Can first run through water so not too salty
4. Add rice wine, soy sauce, and sugar
5. Stir fry until not very liquidy
6. Add chopped 韭菜花
7. Stir fry
    - Not too long or the 韭菜花 will become soft

## Extra notes

- Can add some 海鮮醬 or 蠔油 on step 4 for thickening and sweetening sauce
- Use 辣豆瓣 instead of chili flakes since I have that already
