## Extra notes

- Did not follow any measurements
- Younger basil leaves are more fragrant
- What's the difference Taiwan basil, Thai basil, Thai holy basil??
- Only chopped the peppers and did not pound
- Used some ground pork and shabushabu pork slices
- Used hoisin sauce for oyster sauce, Taiwan basil for holy basil, and Vietnam chilis for Thai chilis
- Skipped long beans, onion, black soy sauce, and egg
- Adding too many peppers is a bad idea
