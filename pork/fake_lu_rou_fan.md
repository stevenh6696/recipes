## Ingredients

- ground pork (a lot)
- onion (entire thing)
- garlic (3/4 cloves)
- soy sauce (whatever arbitrary amount feels right)
- sugar (just a little bit; like 1-2 packets)

## Directions

1. stir fry the onions for a bit, until they're probably cooked, then add the garlic for another minute or so
2. add the pork in, cook until its mostly brown
3. add soy sauce and sugar
4. dump everything in a pot, add a cup of water, and simmer for 1.5 hours (or until most of the water is gone)

## Extra notes

- there are a lot more ingredients that you should use (spices, cooking wine?), but this tasted good enough ig
- if the sauce is still too watery after simmering, turn the heat on medium for a bit to thicken it
