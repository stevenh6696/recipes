## Ingredients

- Pork loin
- All purpose flour
- Egg
- Bread crumbs
- Oil

## Directions

1. Smash the pork so it's not too thick
2. Make cuts between fat and lean meat
3. Season with salt and pepper on both sides and rub in
4. Dip pork in flour &rarr; egg &rarr; flour &rarr; egg &rarr; bread crumbs
5. Fry in oil

- Probably will only do egg once
- Lazy way just pan fry one side at a time and use less oil
- Can smash using back of knife
