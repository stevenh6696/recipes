## Directions

1. Soak noodles for 1.5 hours to soften
2. Slice meat and marinate with soy sauce
3. Coat meat with vegetable oil to prevent sticking
4. Cook meat first
5. Combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, golden mountain sauce, and black soy sauce
6. Add chopped garlic to cold oil and brown
7. Add sliced gai lan and stir
8. Add noodles, sauce, and sugar

## Extra notes

- Make one noodle serving at a time so easier to char the noodles
- Tried adding egg at step 6 but turns to scrambled eggs
