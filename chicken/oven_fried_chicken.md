## Extra notes

- Used less chicken and did not adjust oil/butter
- Try less oil/butter in the pan next time so the breading isn't wet the whole time
- 2 day old flour seems like it's too wet
- Try using corn starch or sweet potato flour in it?
- Tried using corn starch too but only dipped on oil once, dip in oil after flouring next time
  - No oil left in pan
