### Custard Pudding

5. Pour into molds and cover with aluminum foil

## Extra notes
- wait for a few minutes (10?) after pouring the custard into the molds, to allow the air bubbles to surface
- darker (slightly burnt) caramel tastes better; gives it a bitter kick
- can use evaporated milk as well
- could vary the sweetness in the custard and offset with more/less caramel
