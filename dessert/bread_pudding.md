## Ingredients

(about 1/4 of the original recipe, with some slight modifications)

- leftover bit of challah bread (1/4 of the loaf?)
- 1 egg + 1 egg yolk
- 1 cup of half and half
- 2-3 spoonfuls of brown sugar (maybe like 4 tbsp? 5?)
- a few splashes of brandy (maybe 2 tbsp)
- pinch of salt

## Directions

1. Whisk everything except the bread and half and half together.
2. Mix in the half and half.
3. Tear the bread into pieces and soak in the mixture.
4. Pour everything into a baking dish, and bake at 325 degrees for one hour.

## Extra notes
- very good (with ice cream)
- used 3/4 cup whole milk + 1/4 cup heavy cream instead of half and half
- recipe is pretty forgiving in general, approximated almost everything
- will puff up while baking and deflate after you take it out
- WAIT AT LEAST 15 MINUTES BEFORE EATING (extremely hot right out of the oven)
