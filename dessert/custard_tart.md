## Ingredients

### Tart Shell
- 1.5 cups flour
- 2/3 cup confectioner's sugar
- 5 1/4 tbsp cornstarch
- 1/4 tsp salt
- (vanilla bean???)
- 10 tsp butter
- 1 large egg

### Custard Pudding
- 3 eggs (2 eggs, 1 yolk?)
- 45 g sugar
- 200?? g milk
- 140?? g heavy cream
- 20 g condensed milk
- red tea (original uses vanilla bean)

### Caramel Sauce
- 50 g sugar (4 tbsp)
- pinch of salt
- 10 g water (2/3 tbsp)
- 20 g hot water

## Directions

### Tart Shell
1. Combine dry ingredients and butter together. Mix until the butter is crumbly.
2. Add in the egg, and mix until paste-like.
3. Flatten into a basic disc-like shape on plastic wrap (to make it easier to roll out later).
4. Place in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes to harden (until clay-like).
5. Roll out into desired size (put back in refrigerator if it becomes too soft),and press into the pan. Cut the excess dough with a knife.
6. Bake at 350°F for 15 minutes.
7. Let cool completely before filling.

### Custard
1. Beat eggs in a large bowl. Mix in 45 g sugar until smooth.
2. Add milk, heavy cream, condensed milk, and tea leaves into a pot. Heat to a very low simmer, and then turn off the heat to let the tea leaves steep for 5-10 minutes.
3. Pour slowly into the egg mixture to temper the eggs.
4. Strain out the tea leaves, and pour into the tart shell.
5. Bake in the oven (with added containers of hot water) at 300°F for 50-55 minutes.
