## Ingredients

- 3 eggs
- 60 grams (1/4 cup) milk
- 160 grams cream cheese
- 35 grams unsalted butter
- 25 grams cake flour
- 3 grams white vinegar
- 40 grams sugar

## Directions

1. Place parchment paper in baking tin
   - Cut to shape
   - Bottom + vertical one around the sides
   - Vertical one should be loose since it will expand + taller than pan
2. Boil water in pot, turn heat to low after bubbling
3. Place bowl over pan and add milk, cream cheese, and butter
4. Let melt while stirring
5. Turn heat off when no lumps
6. Add egg yolks and mix for around a minute
7. Add flour and mix quickly
   - In case egg cooks
8. Add vinegar to egg yolks
9. Mix with hand mixer, not on highest setting
10. Add sugar in batches
11. Use even lower setting for smoother bubbles
12. Add egg yolks in batches to first mixture and fold in
13. Pour into baking tin
14. Place tin in larger pan + boiling water from step 2 in the large pan
15. Bake at 250 F for 60 minutes
16. Broil for 3 minutes for color
17. Cool for 2-3 hours in fridge first

## Extra notes

- Use smaller baking pan is easier since heated more evenly
- Make sure it's actually set before trying to take it out oops
- Pretty good though
