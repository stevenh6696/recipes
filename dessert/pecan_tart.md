## Ingredients
- par-baked tart crust
- 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup)
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- 3 large room temp eggs
- 1 tbsp bourbon
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3/4 tsp kosher salt
- 3/2 cup pecans
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tbsp powdered sugar

## Directions

1. brown butter in saucepan. add maple syrup and stir occasionally for 2-3 minutes until mixture thickens. remove from heat, and whisk in honey. let cool.
2. combine sugar, eggs, bourbon, vanilla, and salt. whisk in syrup mixture.
3. chop pecans and place into tart crust. pour filling over the pecans. bake at 400 for 10 minutes, then reduce to 350 and bake for another 35 minutes.
4. make whipped cream with the heavy cream and powdered sugar. serve with the tart once cooled.

## Extra notes
- a tiny bit of filling (pecans + syrup) left over, bc otherwise it would overflow. maybe try to keep the tart edges taller next time?
- use a little extra salt
- imo needs a lot of whipped cream, bc otherwise would be too heavy
