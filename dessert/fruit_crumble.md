## Ingredients

- 1 cup flour
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/3 cup butter
- Berry filling
  - 3 cups berries
  - 1 teaspoon lemon zest
  - 2 teaspoons lemon juice

  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 cup water
  - Lemon juice

## Directions

1. Mix flour, white sugar, brown sugar, and butter
2. Mix everything for fruit filling
    - Corn starch is for thickening
    - Do right before baking since the sugar will draw water out
3. Put half of crumble mixture on bottom of dish and pat down
4. Pour in fruit filling
5. Put other half of crumble on top in crumble form
6. Put dish on top of pan with parchment paper since it might overflow
7. Bake at 375 F for 45 minutes
8. Broil for a bit
9. Let cool for half an hour
10. Serve with vanilla ice cream

## Extra notes

- Using reddit for easy crumble, Chef John for filling
- Skipped lemon zest and cayenne, used all purpose flour instead of corn starch for berry filling
- Used double for crumble since put some on bottom
