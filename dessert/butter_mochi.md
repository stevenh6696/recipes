## Ingredients

(halved from the original recipe)
- half stick of butter
- 1 cup of granulated sugar (used brown sugar instead)
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- 8 oz sticky rice flour (a little under 2 cups)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 6 oz of evaporated milk (3/4 cup) (used half and half instead)
- 7 oz of coconut milk (7/8 cup)

## Directions

1. Mix melted butter and sugar until combined. 
2. Add eggs and vanilla. 
3. Pour in sticky rice and baking powder. Stir until smooth.
4. Stir in evaporated milk and coconut milk.
5. Pour into baking dish and bake for one hour at 350 degrees.

## Extra notes

- used brown sugar instead of white sugar (strongly advised)
- used half and half instead of evaporated milk, because I didn't want to buy evaporated milk
- used a pinch of baking soda + lemon juice to replace the baking powder
- buttered the baking dish very well
- the edge pieces taste very nice fresh out of the oven
- didn't use enough sticky rice flour bc I fucked up the conversion from oz to cups, so it was a little too mushy
- maybe use some regular flour next time too, to make it a little more bread-like and filling
