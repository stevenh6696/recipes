## Ingredients

### Filling
halved from original because I fucked up the custard tart shell  
probably a good amount for a regular sized pie too, 2 cans of condensed milk is insane
- 3 egg yolks
- 1 can of condensed milk
- juice from 3 (or 2?) limes
- maybe some lime zest

### Pie Crust
reference video uses graham cracker i think. i used my fucked up custard tart shell.

## Directions

1. Whisk egg yolks until light and fluffy.
2. Mix in condensed milk.
3. Mix in lime juice.
4. Pour into pie crust of choice, and bake for 10-12 minutes at 350Â°F.
5. Let cool in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.

## Extra notes

- topped with meringue instead of whipped cream because what else am i going to do with 3 egg whites
- MAKE SURE TO HAVE THE MERINGUE READY WHEN THE THING COMES OUT OF THE OVEN
- or just bake it with the filling simultaneously???
- used only 1/4 cup lime juice (1 lime); wayyy to sweet
