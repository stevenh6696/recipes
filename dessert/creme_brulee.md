## Ingredients

3/4 from original
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 3 egg yolks
- 1/3 cup sugar
- brown sugar for caramelization

## Directions

1. Add milk and heavy cream to saucepan on low heat.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.
3. Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring, and then immediately turn off (as soon as bubbles form) and set aside to cool for 10-15 minutes.
4. Mix egg yolks and sugar in separate bowl until pale yellow.
5. Slowly strain the milk mixture into the egg yolks (tempering).
6. Pour into ramekins and bake at 250 for 45-60 minutes. The center should only be slightly wobbly when done.
7. Let cool and place in refrigerator for at least 3 hours to set.
8. Sprinkle an even layer of brown sugar on top (maybe about 1 tablespoon max for a single ramekin).
9. Either broil for a few minutes (2-3 inches from heat source), or use a blowtorch.

## Extra notes
- added red tea leaves to the milk mixture for flavoring, plus some brandy as a substitute for vanilla
- used french dude's recipe, baked at 210 for an hour, still way too wobbly. baked again at 285 for 15 minutes, a little too bubbly on top when done. hopefully 250 is a good number for next time.
- broiling method works, but custard is too warm afterwards and tastes weird. put back in the fridge until its cool again to eat.
