## Ingredients

(halved from the original recipe)

### Dough
- 3/8 cup whole milk
- 15 grams fresh yeast (1.6 tsp of instant yeast, 6 grams active dry)
- 2 1/4 cup flour (original uses half bread, half pastry)
- 1 large egg at room temperature
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- 4 1/4 tablespoon room temperature butter (cubed)

### Filling
(just eyeball it)
- 225 grams Nutella
- 11/6 grams chocolate chips

### Sugar Syrup
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 1/6 cup water

## Directions

1. Add milk, egg, sugar, salt, and vanilla extract into a bowl and whisk together.
2. Add in flour, butter, and yeast and combine until a dough forms.
3. Knead for about 10? minutes.
4. Tightly wrap with plastic wrap and proof in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.

## Extra notes
- turned out a lot better than expected
- ROLL THE DOUGH VERY THINLY (the braid looks bad if you dont get many layers)
- use small chocolate chips
- don't stir the sugar syrup while its heating
