## Ingredients

### Coffee Syrup

- 1/2 cup of really strong coffee (maybe 1 cup would be better)
- 2/3 tbsp raw sugar (or 3/4 granulated???)
- maybe add some of that brandy in too

### Custard filling thing

- 2 egg yolks
- 4 tbsp of sugar (2.5 for the egg yolks, 1.5 for the whipped cream)
- 1 tbsp rum
- 200g mascarpone
- 80ml heavy cream
- 1 egg white

### Lady Fingers

- buy some lady fingers (or watch the youtube video to make)

## Directions

1. Mix together the egg yolks and 2.5 tbsp of sugar, and add in 1 tbsp of rum.
2. Beat the mixture over a hot water bath until it thickens.
3. Whisk in mascarpone.
4. Beat the heavy cream, and mix in with the egg yolk mixture.
5. Beat the egg white and 1.5 tbsp of sugar, and fold in a little bit at a time with the rest.
6. Dip the ladyfingers in the coffee + brandy mixture, and layer in a dish with the creamy egg yolk thing.
7. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, and then sprinkle with cocoa powder.

## Extra notes

- tastes pretty fucking good
- whipping by hand is awful. eggs whites take forever.
